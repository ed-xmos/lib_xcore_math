/**
 * @brief Obtain the output exponent and input shifts to add or subtract two 16- or 32-bit BFP vectors.
 * 
 * The block floating-point functions in this library which add or subtract vectors are of the general form:
 * 
 * @math{ 
 *      \bar{a} \cdot 2^{a\_exp} = \bar{b}\cdot 2^{b\_exp} \pm \bar{c}\cdot 2^{c\_exp} }
 * }
 * 
 * @vector{b} and @vector{c} are the input mantissa vectors with exponents @math{b\_exp} and @math{c\_exp}, which are 
 * shared by each element of their respective vectors. @vector{a} is the output mantissa vector with exponent 
 * @math{a\_exp}. Two additional properties, @math{b\_hr} and @math{c\_hr}, which are the 
 * headroom of mantissa vectors @vector{b} and @vector{c} respectively, are required by this function.
 * 
 * In order to avoid any overflows in the output mantissas, the output exponent @math{a\_exp} must be chosen such that 
 * the largest (in the sense of absolute value) possible output mantissa will fit into the allotted space (e.g. 32 bits
 * for xs3_vect_s32_add()). Once @math{a\_exp} is chosen, the input bit-shifts @math{b\_shr} and @math{c\_shr} are 
 * calculated to achieve that resulting exponent.
 * 
 * This function chooses @math{a\_exp} to be the minimum exponent known to avoid overflows, given the input exponents
 * (@math{b\_exp} and @math{c\_exp}) and input headroom (@math{b\_hr} and @math{c\_hr}).
 * 
 * This function is used calculate the output exponent and input bit-shifts for each of the following functions:
 * * xs3_vect_s16_add()
 * * xs3_vect_s32_add()
 * * xs3_vect_s16_sub()
 * * xs3_vect_s32_sub()
 * * xs3_vect_complex_s16_add()
 * * xs3_vect_complex_s32_add()
 * * xs3_vect_complex_s16_sub()
 * * xs3_vect_complex_s32_sub()
 * 
 * @par Adjusting Output Exponents
 * 
 * If a specific output exponent `desired_exp` is needed for the result (e.g. for emulating fixed-point arithmetic), the 
 * `b_shr` and `c_shr` produced by this function can be adjusted according to the following:
 * \code{.c}
 *      exponent_t desired_exp = ...; // Value known a priori
 *      right_shift_t new_b_shr = b_shr + (desired_exp - a_exp);
 *      right_shift_t new_c_shr = c_shr + (desired_exp - a_exp);
 * \endcode
 * 
 * When applying the above adjustment, the following conditions should be maintained:
 * * `b_hr + b_shr >= 0`
 * * `c_hr + c_shr >= 0`
 * 
 * Be aware that using smaller values than strictly necessary for `b_shr` and `c_shr` can result in saturation, and 
 * using larger values may result in unnecessary underflows or loss of precision.
 * 
 * @par Notes
 * 
 * * If @math{b\_hr} or @math{c\_hr} are unknown, they can be calculated using the appropriate headroom function 
 * (e.g. xs3_vect_complex_s16_headroom() for complex 16-bit vectors) or the value `0` can always be safely used (but may 
 * result in reduced precision).

/**
 * @brief Obtain the output exponent and input shifts used by xs3_vect_complex_s32_scale().
 * 
 * This function is used in conjunction with xs3_vect_complex_s32_scale() to perform a complex multiplication of a 
 * complex 32-bit BFP vector by a complex 32-bit scalar.
 * 
 * This function computes `a_exp`, `b_shr` and `c_shr`.
 * 
 * `a_exp` is the exponent associated with mantissa vector @vector{a}, and must be chosen to be large enough to avoid 
 * overflow when elements of @vector{a} are computed. To maximize precision, this function chooses `a_exp` to be the 
 * smallest exponent known to avoid saturation (see exception below). The `a_exp` chosen by this function is derived 
 * from the exponents and headrooms associated with the input vectors.
 * 
 * `b_shr` and `c_shr` are the shift parameters required by xs3_vect_complex_s32_mul() to achieve the chosen output 
 * exponent `a_exp`.
 * 
 * `b_exp` and `c_exp` are the exponents associated with the input mantissa vectors @vector{b} and @vector{c} 
 * respectively.
 * 
 * `b_hr` and `c_hr` are the headroom of @vector{b} and @vector{c} respectively. If the headroom of @vector{b} or 
 * @vector{c} is unknown, they can be obtained by calling xs3_vect_complex_s32_headroom(). Alternatively, the value `0`
 * can always be safely used (but may result in reduced precision).
 * 
 * @par Adjusting Output Exponents
 * 
 * If a specific output exponent `desired_exp` is needed for the result (e.g. for emulating fixed-point arithmetic), the 
 * `b_shr` and `c_shr` produced by this function can be adjusted according to the following:
 * \code{.c}
 *      exponent_t desired_exp = ...; // Value known a priori
 *      right_shift_t new_b_shr = b_shr + (desired_exp - a_exp);
 *      right_shift_t new_c_shr = c_shr + (desired_exp - a_exp);
 * \endcode
 * 
 * When applying the above adjustment, the following conditions should be maintained:
 * * `b_hr + b_shr >= 0`
 * * `c_hr + c_shr >= 0`
 * 
 * Be aware that using smaller values than strictly necessary for `b_shr` and `c_shr` can result in saturation, and 
 * using larger values may result in unnecessary underflows or loss of precision.
 * 
 * @par Notes
 * 
 * * Using the outputs of this function, an output mantissa which would otherwise be `INT32_MIN` will instead saturate 
 *   to `-INT32_MAX`. This is due to the symmetric saturation logic employed by the VPU and is a hardware feature. This 
 *   is a corner case which is usually unlikely and results in 1 LSb of error when it occurs.

 * saturation of @math{b_k'} and @math{c_k'} is to be avoided). The less headroom @math{b_k'} and @math{c_k'} have, the
 * greater the precision of the final result.
 * 
 * Internally, each product @math{(b_k' \cdot c_k' \cdot 2^{-30})} accumulates into one of eight 40-bit accumulators 
 * (which are all used simultaneously) which apply symmetric 40-bit saturation logic (with bounds @math{\approx 2^{39})
 * with each value added. The saturating arithmetic employed is _not associative_ and no indication is given if 
 * saturation occurs at an intermediate step. To avoid satuation errors, `length` should be no greater than 
 * @math{2^{10+b\_hr+c\_hr}}, where @math{b\_hr} and @math{c\_hr} are the headroom of @vector{b} and @vector{c} 
 * respectively.
 * 
 * If the caller's mantissa vectors are longer than that, the full inner product can be found by calling this function 
 * multiple times for partial inner products on sub-sequences of the input vectors, and adding the results in user code. 
 * 
 * In many situations the caller may have _a priori_ knowledge that saturation is impossible (or very nearly so), in

 * @brief Obtain the output exponent and input shift used by xs3_vect_s32_dot().
 * 
 * This function is used in conjunction with xs3_vect_s32_dot() to compute the inner product of two 32-bit BFP vectors.
 * 
 * This function computes `a_exp`, `b_shr` and `c_shr`.
 * 
 * `a_exp` is the exponent associated with the 64-bit mantissa @math{a} returned by xs3_vect_s32_dot(), and must be 
 * chosen to be large enough to avoid saturation when @math{a} is computed. To maximize precision, this function chooses
 * `a_exp` to be the smallest exponent known to avoid saturation (see exception below). The `a_exp` chosen by this 
 * function is derived from the exponents and headrooms associated with the input vectors.
 * 
 * `b_shr` and `c_shr` are the shift parameters required by xs3_vect_s32_dot() to achieve the chosen output exponent 
 * `a_exp`.
 * 
 * `b_exp` and `c_exp` are the exponents associated with the input mantissa vectors @vector{b} and @vector{c} 
 * respectively.
 * 
 * `b_hr` and `c_hr` are the headroom of @vector{b} and @vector{c} respectively. If either is unknown, they can be 
 * obtained using xs3_vect_s32_headroom(). Alternatively, the value `0` can always be safely used (but may result in 
 * reduced precision).
 * 
 * `length` is the number of elements in the input mantissa vectors @vector{b} and @vector{c}.
 * 
 * @par Adjusting Output Exponents
 * 
 * If a specific output exponent `desired_exp` is needed for the result (e.g. for emulating fixed-point arithmetic), the 
 * `b_shr` and `c_shr` produced by this function can be adjusted according to the following:
 * \code{.c}
 *      exponent_t desired_exp = ...; // Value known a priori
 *      right_shift_t new_b_shr = b_shr + (desired_exp - a_exp);
 *      right_shift_t new_c_shr = c_shr + (desired_exp - a_exp);
 * \endcode
 * 
 * When applying the above adjustment, the following conditions should be maintained:
 * * `b_hr + b_shr >= 0`
 * * `c_hr + c_shr >= 0`
 * 
 * Be aware that using smaller values than strictly necessary for `b_shr` or `c_shr` can result in saturation, and using 
 * larger values may result in unnecessary underflows or loss of precision.

 * @math{a\_exp = 30 + 2 \cdot (b\_exp + b\_shr) }.
 * 
 * The function xs3_vect_s32_energy_prepare() can be used to obtain values for @math{a\_exp}, @math{b\_shr} and 
 * @math{c\_shr} based on the input exponents @math{b\_exp} and @math{c\_exp} and the input headrooms @math{b\_hr} and 
 * @math{c\_hr}.
 * 
 * @par Additional Details
 * 
 * The 30-bit rounding right-shift applied to each element of the 64-bit products @math{(b_k')^2} is a feature of the 
 * hardware and cannot be avoided. As such, if the input vector @vector{b} has too much headroom (i.e. 
 * @math{2\cdot b\_hr}), the sum may effectively vanish. To avoid this situation, negative values of `b_shr` may be used
 * (with the stipulation that @math{b\_shr \ge -b\_hr} if satuartion of @math{b_k'} is to be avoided). The less headroom
 * @math{b_k'} has, the greater the precision of the final result.
 * 
 * Internally, each product @math{(b_k')^2 \cdot 2^{-30}} accumulates into one of eight 40-bit accumulators (which are 
 * all used simultaneously) which apply symmetric 40-bit saturation logic (with bounds @math{\approx 2^{39}) with each
 * value added. The saturating arithmetic employed is _not associative_ and no indication is given if saturation occurs
 * at an intermediate step. To avoid saturation errors, `length` should be no greater than @math{2^{10+2\cdotb\_hr}}, 
 * where @math{b\_hr} is the headroom of @vector{b}.
 * 
 * If the caller's mantissa vector is longer than that, the full result can be found by calling this function multiple 
 * times for partial results on sub-sequences of the input, and adding the results in user code. 
 * 
 * In many situations the caller may have _a priori_ knowledge that saturation is impossible (or very nearly so), in 
 * which case this guideline may be disregarded. However, such situations are application-specific and are well beyond 
 * the scope of this documentation, and as such are left to the user's discretion.

/**
 * @brief Obtain the output exponent and shift parameter used by xs3_vect_s32_sqrt().
 * 
 * This function is used in conjunction withx xs3_vect_s32_sqrt() to compute the square root of elements of a 32-bit
 * BFP vector.
 * 
 * This function computes `a_exp` and `b_shr`.
 * 
 * `a_exp` is the exponent associated with output mantissa vector @vector{a}, and should be chosen to maximize the 
 * precision of the results. To that end, this function chooses `a_exp` to be the smallest exponent known to avoid 
 * saturation of the resulting mantissa vector @vector{a}. It is derived from the exponent and headroom of the input
 * BFP vector.
 * 
 * `b_shr` is the shift parameter required by xs3_vect_s32_sqrt() to achieve the chosen output exponent `a_exp`.
 * 
 * `b_exp` is the exponent associated with the input mantissa vector @vector{b}.
 * 
 * `b_hr` is the headroom of @vector{b}. If it is unknown, it can be obtained using xs3_vect_s32_headroom(). 
 * Alternatively, the value `0` can always be safely used (but may result in reduced precision).
 * 
 * @par Adjusting Output Exponents
 * 
 * If a specific output exponent `desired_exp` is needed for the result (e.g. for emulating fixed-point arithmetic), the 
 * `b_shr` produced by this function can be adjusted according to the following:
 * \code{.c}
 *      exponent_t a_exp;
 *      right_shift_t b_shr;
 *      xs3_vect_s16_mul_prepare(&a_exp, &b_shr, b_exp, c_exp, b_hr, c_hr);
 *      exponent_t desired_exp = ...; // Value known a priori
 *      b_shr = b_shr + (desired_exp - a_exp);
 *      a_exp = desired_exp;
 * \endcode
 * 
 * When applying the above adjustment, the following condition should be maintained:
 * * `b_hr + b_shr >= 0`
 * 
 * Be aware that using smaller values than strictly necessary for `b_shr` can result in saturation, and using larger 
 * values may result in unnecessary underflows or loss of precision.
 * 
 * Also, if a larger exponent is used than necessary, a larger `depth` parameter (see xs3_vect_s32_sqrt()) will be 
 * required to achieve the same precision, as the results are computed bit by bit, starting with the most significant
 * bit.
